Test of Knowledge/ Daniel Lehman 4/5
OOP
In Python, what is an object called
class
method
variable
method
1
Because it is
OOP
Where should your class definitions go in your source code?
Near the top of the code 
Right after the class is used in the program 
It does not matter where the class definition is located in the source code 
At the end of the program 
1
Number 1 because it's the best practice as programmers
OOP
Which keyword is used to create a method inside a class definition?
def 
function 
class 
method 
1
Because function is in java script, method isn't a thing in python, class is a diferent thing
OOP
Data that is held in class variables is also referred to by what term(s)?
class or object 
property or attribute 
OOP 
method or function 
2
Because property and attributes are data and functions and methods are declaration in a class.
OOP
Which type of object relationship is best described as having one object "own" another object as part of the internal data?
"Is-A"
"Uses-A"
"Has-A"
"Like-A"
3
It has an attribute and doesn't do anything with it.
Imports
When creating a date, time or datetime object, which integer parameter should range between 1 and 12?
day 
minute 
month 
year 
3
Because there are 12 months in a year
Imports
The datetime strftime() function is capable of creating a string in which of the following styles?
Monday, January 19, 2004 
Mon Jan 19 13:30:00 2004 
2004-01-19 01:30:00 PM 
All of the above
4
All of them are correct
Imports
A timedelta object does NOT contain which of the following properties?
years 
days 
seconds 
microseconds 
1
Because it's not a built in class
Imports
Which of the following statements will successfully initialize a timedelta object?
myDelta = datetime.timedelta(days=10, hours=20, minutes=40) 
myDelta = datetime.timedelta(days=10) 
All of these will work  
myDelta = datetime.timedelta(minutes=10, seconds=30)
3
Because they are all valid arguments
imports
Which of the following statements will let you use the random library functions in your code?
use random 
import random 
random.randrange() 
rand 
2
Because it imports a random function
Code Format
Python will run your program statements in what order?
From bottom to top
From right to left
From top to bottom
From shortest to longest
3
Number 3 because it is easier for humans to understand when writing code.
Programmer Lingo
What general term to software engineers use to describe errors in programs?
Breakpoints
Bugs
Tracepoints
Flops
2
Number 2 because before coding was all digital there were bugs that would sneak into the computer causing problems and it stuck for the community.
Debugging
What is wrong with the following code? age = int( input (How old are you?) )
It is missing double quotes around the input() string parameter
It will throw an exception at runtime due to the nested function calls
It does not correctly assign the result value to the variable
Nothing is wrong; the statement will run successfully
1
Number 1 because the argument that the input statement takes is a string.
Functions
Which of the following statements will return the number of items in a list named "marbles"?
len(marbles)
marbles.length
marbles.size()
size(marbles)
1
Number 1 because size isn't a function in python and .length is in other languages, but not python.
Lists
Which of the following list functions will NOT work on a tuple?
These will all work on a tuple
index()
count()
pop()
4
Number 4 because a tuple can't be mutated and pop deletes a certain element in a list.
Programming techniques
What software philosophy uses software objects to organize re-usable code and to represent real-world concepts or things?
Object-Oriented Programming 
Structured Programming 
Python Zen 
Console Programming 
1
Because it allows the user to reuse code
OOP
When a function is defined within a class, what is it called
variable 
object 
value 
method 
4
Because thats what it's called by programmers
Loops
How long will a "while" loop continue iterating?
For the number of times specified in the range()
As long as the loop index variable is equal to False
An infinite number of times; there is no way to break out of a "while" loop
As long as the loop's logical expression is True
4
Number 4 because the syntax makes sense with, while running is true, it will keep going.
Loops
Which keyword would you use to halt the current loop iteration and immediately continue at the top of the loop again?
break
continue
return
jump
2
Number 2 because return will leave the loop if in a function, and break will leave without being in a function. Jump doesn't exist.
Functions
A function's input parameters are treated as _____ scope variables.
local
global
international
general
1
Number 1 because local refers to only be used inside the function and won't be recognized outside of the function.
